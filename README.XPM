================================= README.XPM  =================================

6/15/94		Version 3.671

You can obtain XPM via anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu in the contrib
directory, or from avahi.inria.fr in the pub directory.

10/16/93	Version 3.57

If you have the X pixmap library installed in the standard X library and
include locations, you do not need to do anything special to use XPM.

If Xpm is installed in a different location, edit FWF.tmpl to specify the
location of the library and include file.

If you do not have the library, and you don't want to use it, then set the
HaveXpm flag to 0 in FWF.tmpl.  This will disable the XPM support.  As a
result, certain widgets and test programs may not be as flexible, and other
widgets may not be placed in the library altogether.

8/26/1993	Version 3.56

Several FWF users have noted that the FWF release doesn't build on their
system because they do not have the Xpm libraries installed on their system.
(Xpm is the X Pixmap color image libraries from Groupe Bull in France)

In the past, FWF included a version of the xpm library with the FWF release,
but it was removed when most versions of X11 were shipped with the Xpm library
and include files as part of the basic distribution.  Apparently, many vendors
do not ship Xpm with their X release, and we are discussing ways to properly
fix the situation.

In the mean time, there are two approaches to resolve this problem.

(1) Get the XPM library and include files and install them on your machine.
    Put them in the standard X include and library search path so they can
    be found.
(2) Do not build the sections of the library which use the Xpm support.
    For version 3.56, this involves:
	(a) editing FWF/src/PixelEditor/PixEditT.h to #define NO_XPM
	(b) editing FWF/src/Imakefile to remove the following widgets from
	    the SUBDIRS list:
		Animator
		Icon
		IconBox
		Pager
	(c) Some widgets may include these widgets now, or in the future.  If
	    the system won't build because a widget includes one of these above
	    widgets, then remove that widget from the SUBDIRS list also.  Trial
	    and error is best here.  Hopefully you won't have to do anything
	    for this step, or at most very little.

We'll try to get a real fix for this problem in the next release.
