Scrollbar (Superclass: XfwfBoard) A Scrollbar widget has four parts: a
	trough in which a slider moves up and down (or left and right)
	and two arrows. Clicking and dragging on the different parts
	causes a callback to be invoked with different arguments,
	which presumably causes another widget to scroll.
