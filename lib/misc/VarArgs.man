.SH NAME
XfwfCreateArgsList \- convert a va_list into an XtVarArgsList.  Very
handy for those convenience procedures that create a widget and you
want to have a Va form available.  Motif is \fBseverly\fP lacking in
this respect, but then, Motif sucks.

.SH EXCUSE

  I don't have time to document this right now.  If you are interested
in using it, bug me and I'll write docs.

.SH Trademarks and other Legal Bullshit

 Motif is a trademark or some sort of legally protected thing of some
organization.  I don't give a shit.
