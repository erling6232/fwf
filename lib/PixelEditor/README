	This is the PixelEditor widget package, which is currently under
development.  The goal is to provide a useful building block for pixel
editing applications, so people do not have to constantly reinvent the
wheel.

	This is currently a Beta version of this package.  Many features
still need to be added and bugs most likely will need to be ironed out.
What I ask is that you try to use this widget and give me feedback as to
how well it works and what things are difficult to do.  This feedback is
essential.


	This package currently contains the following files:

	README				This file
	PixEdit.doc			Initial ASCII documentation
	PixEdit.man			Man page for the PixelEditor widget

	PixEdit.c			Widget source code
	PixEditP.h			Widget private include file
	PixEdit.h			Widget public include file
	PixEdit.brush			Brush shape files

	PixEdit_test.c			Sample pixel editor application
