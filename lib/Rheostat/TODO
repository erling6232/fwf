OUTSTANDING BUGS:

    There is some confusion with respect to the callback names.
    One is called XtNset*Callback*,  the other is called XtNnotify.
    Should rename the latter to XtNnotifyCallback, or at least
    make an alias.

    Need a more comprehensive demo, and better documentation.

    Need to make it easier to generate the Motif version.
    (Check how others do this... I think some of Bert Bos' and John
    Cwikla's widgets are dual-version widgets too.)

    Add textual indicator?

    Add tick labels?

    Add major ticks?
