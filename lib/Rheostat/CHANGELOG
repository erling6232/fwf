CHANGES to XfwfRheostat widget:

    11-Oct-1994
	Modified RheostatT test program:
	it now has a 'quit' button, and has two dial widgets 
	whose values are linked together.

	By a suggestion from Daniel V. Klein, 
	in Motif version, set keyboard focus to the widget
	on Set() action (if caused by ButtonPress event).

	Added Rheostat.txt as per FWF submission guidelines.

	Updated manpage to include tickThickness resource,
	acknowledgments.

    26-Sep-1994
	(Rheostat.c r1.6->r1.6.1.1; some parts merged into r1.8)
	Daniel V. Klein (dvk@lonewolf.com) made several improvements:

	Most notable is that the widget does not erase and redraw
	itself when the value changes; this has made a tremendous
	performance increase.

	Some changes to geometry calculation, including a
	QueryGeometry method.

	Dials can have reversed ranges (i.e., largest value clockwise
	of the smallest).

	Some changes to drawing parameters: Tick marks and arc are
	now CapButt instead of CapRound and the indicator is now JoinRound
	instead of JoinMiter.  These gave problems with thick lines.

	Added a meta-resource called "foreground", which sets all of
	arrow_color, tick_color, and dial_color.

    14-Sep-1993
	(Rheostat.c r1.6->r1.7)
	BUGFIX: With tick gravity on, clicking near a tick corresponding to
	a *negative* value caused the indicator to jump one tick to the
	right of the correct tick.  Thanks to Greg Janee <greg@cs.ucsb.edu>
	for this fix.

    15-Jul-1993
	(Rheostat.c r1.5->r1.6)
	In Set() action, peg the indicator to one side if the value
	is out of range instead of just freezing.


    07-Jul-1993
	Rheostat.man didn't format right using groff (probably
	didn't work with nroff either.)

    25-Jun-1993
	BUGFIX: (Rheostat.c) calculate_position was ignoring minimumValue.
	(thanks to James R. R. Service for this fix)

    21-Sep-92
	Renamed all global widget type and structure names to begin
	with [Xx]fwf.

	The width/height/radius initialization logic has been cleaned
	up some; it now checks the radius against the arrow dimensions.

	RheostatT now has command-line options.

	*fillArrow is now OFF by default.  It was just too slow on
	some servers.

	Uses the '#include <Xfwf/...>' convention.
	XDrawArrow() is now XfwfDrawArrow(), and is public.
