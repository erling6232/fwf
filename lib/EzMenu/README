	EzMenu is a simple menu package built by Dirk Grunwald on top of the
	X11R4 Athena menu widgets.  It allows you to construct menu trees
	from resource descriptions.

	To try the sample program first load the resource file EzMenu.res
	with xrdb and then run the test program EzMenuT, which will construct
	a menu based on the description in the file EzMenu.res.
