                                Mdial Widget
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  I was getting mail every so often about my Hdial widget, mainly people
wondering if I had updated it or made a Motif type version.  Now I have.

  I've compiled it on a bunch of machines and it seems to work, so I'll let
it go at that.  I'm using R5 on a Sparc 2 with Motif-1.2.2 and have 
also compiled it on an HP9000/700 with R5 and Motif-1.2.2.  You will need
Motif-1.2 to use this!

  Basically this is a Motif-a-like dial. I don't have any docs for it yet,
so you'll have to figure out what the resources do for yourself...(If 
anyone wants to write docs for it, by all means do!).  Play with the
demo program to see what they do, it uses most of the fun features...

Neato keen things:

No tick marks, but there is diamond at the min point.
Arm shadows follow the light.
Drag and Drop (drag at least...)
Resource for formatting the label to be whatever you want.
Display only mode.

Bad things:

Probably could have subclassed of of XmLabel, but I used XmPrimitive instead
The half height version doesn't really draw correctly.



  That's about it.  Let me know what you think, and if I get encouraged
then maybe I'll write some more...See copyright or source files for
