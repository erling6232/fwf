This directory contains C source for the Calendar widget.

The Calendar widget shows a calendar for one month.  Buttons in the header
allow the calendar month to be changed.  Individual dates within the calendar
can be set to one of 5 different colors. Callbacks are provided for when the
user changes the displayed month, or clicks on a date in the calendar.

The widget is subclassed from the XfwfBoard widget so that location management
and framing is possible.  If it is desired to use the Calendar widget 
independently from the FWF widget set, The following changes are required:

    1. Subclass the widget from Core instead of XfwfBoard. e.g. replace
          @class XfwfCalendar (XfwfBoard) @file=Calendar
       with
          @class XfwfCalendar (Core) @file=Calendar

    2. Wherever a call to "compute_inside" occurs, replace it with
            wx=wy=0;
            wh=$width;
            ww=$width;

    3. In the "expose" method remove the call to the superclass expose
       method. e.g. remove the line
          	#expose($,event,region);

Many thanks are due to the other authors of FWF widgets from whom I have 
learned much.
