	This directory contains the C source for the MultiList widget, which
	is a widget, similar to the Athena List widget, but with the
	following significant differences:

		* Multiple items can be selected at one time.
		* Colors can be specified for highlighting.
		* In addition to setting and unsetting items with the
		  Set() and Unset() actions, MultiList also supports toggling
		  (selected item becomes unselected, unselected item becomes
		  selected) with Toggle() and opening of objects (e.g.
		  might be used with a double-click) with Open().
		* The return structure is now more complicated, listing
		  what type of operation generated the callback (highlighting
		  an item, unhighlighting an item, opening an item, requesting
		  the current status), what item was clicked on to produce this
		  callback, and the list of what items are currently
		  selected.
		* Items can be individually disabled, by setting the
		  sensitivity array.
		* internalWidth and internalHeight resources have been
		  removed.
