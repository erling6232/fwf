This directory contains the sources for a progress meter widget: CircPerc.
This widget can be used to display the progress an application is making, for
instance when during lengthy computations. This is done by displaying a
circle, divided in two different colored parts. One part indicates the
percentage completed, the complementary part the percentage not yet completed.
Percentages can be specified with a two decimal accuracy. The widget tries to
minimize the amount of drawing needed.
