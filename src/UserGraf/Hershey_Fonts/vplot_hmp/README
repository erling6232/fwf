This directory contains everything you need to create yourself a nice
set of Vplot fonts GIVEN the hershey font set already. (You can get the
Hershey font distribution from hanauma.stanford.edu .) Note that the .hmp
files here are somewhat different (better) from the .hmp files that come
with the Hershey fonts. (IE, keep the .oc files, since they contain
what you need, but throw away their .hmp files and use mine instead.)

Only "normal" sized fonts are used. If you want small characters, just scale
down the normal-sized ones!

Documentation is contained in the beginning lines of all .csh and .c files,
although the "make_vplot.csh" shell should do everything for you.

Note that the "romant" font of the Hershey fonts has an error in it. If you
have the "Hershey_Fonts" directory as part of your distribution, you will find
the "fixed" romant.vplot_font file there. Otherwise, read the comments in
make_vplot.csh and fix the error by hand (or do without).

The files in this directory are NOT under the Vplot copyright, as
some files contain code from the Hershey Font distribution.

When will somebody create some Japanese-language fonts using this directory
and the .or files from the Hershey distribution?
