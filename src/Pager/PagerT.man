.TH "PagerT" "1" "3 Dec 1992" "Version 3.0" "Free Widget Foundation"
.SH NAME
PagerT \- Test program for the XfwfPager widget
.SH SYNOPSIS
PagerT [file]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The program displays the contents of the
.I file
if it was present, otherwise it executes
.B ls -l.
The text is
paginated and with the help of the "dog's ear" in the lower right
corner the pages can be flipped.
.PP
The name of the file is shown along the top of the window.
.PP
Two buttons at the bottom serve to stop the program or to choose a
different file. The
.B Open
button starts a file selector dialog.
.PP
All files are first piped through
.I expand
in order to remove the tabs. (The Pager widget can't deal with tabs
yet.)
.PP
The default configuration is set up to show pages of 25 lines each,
regardless of the size of the window. The program will try to load
an Times scalable font, so that the letters grow when the window
is enlarged. Set the resource 
.B PagerT.board.pager.lines
to -1 in order to keep constant size fonts and make the widget adjust
the number of lines automatically.
