XmAnsiTerm (superclass: XmPrimitive) The AnsiTerm widget emulates an
	ANSI terminal in an X Window. It displays lines of text and
	scrolls them if necessary. It displays a cursor, to indicate
	where the next text will appear and it interprets the ANSI
	escape codes to position the cursor or highlight the text.
