FileLister: this widget is a modification of Brian Totty's FileSelector
widget.  Besides the functionality provided by FileSelector, the FileLister
provides the capability of generating a list of files, as well as their 
paths.  The FileLister returns a count of the selected files, and pointers
to two arrays of String: one for the paths, and one for the files.

Three new buttons have been added to the display, to support the list of
selected files.  "Path" gives the path of a file highlighted in the selection
list.  "Remove" deletes a selected file (and its path) from the list.
"Clear" zeros the entire list.

The test program provided, FileListT, is, not surprisingly, a modification 
of FileSelT.  The "OK" button prints a list of the selected files and their
paths.


Important: The current maximum number of files for the selection list is 120.
This is probably more files than most patient people would want to hand-pick
with such a widget.  If you'd like to modify this value, it must be changed
in *both* FileList.h and FileListP.h.  This will hopefully be fixed in a
future revision (recommendations welcome).
