FileLister
	this widget is a modification of Brian Totty's FileSelector
	widget.  Besides the functionality provided by FileSelector,
	the FileLister provides the capability of generating a list of
	files, as well as their paths.  The FileLister returns a count
	of the selected files, and pointers to two arrays of String:
	one for the paths, and one for the files.
